				<p class="gray">Kombucha, a fermented tea, is steadily gaining in popularity among Paleo advocates, health connoisseurs, and well, people that just like a darn delicious drink.  Due to its sweet taste and slight alcohol content, itâ€™s even been used to help individuals who want to get a grip on their sugar or alcohol cravings.
