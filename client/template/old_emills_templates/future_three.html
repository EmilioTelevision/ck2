				<p class="gray">Ironically, I discovered Kombucha after alcohol almost killed me. As Kombucha brought me back to life and I got addicted to its cleansing bite, I realized that Kombucha makes for the perfect recipe for alcoholic drinks that are not so hard that they are not refreshing anymore and consumed more slowly, in a zen-like fashion. People enjoying drinks together is inevitable--it's part of our culture, and how we make great friends & memories. Conscious Kombucha offers the recipe for positive nights out, period. Look out for a Conscious Kombucha tap at your local California bars and restaurants, and if you're a bar-owner or restauranteur, we would love to install our fairly priced All-In-One Kombucha Tap dispenser at your venue soon!
