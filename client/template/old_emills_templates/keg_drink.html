				<h2 class="blue_title_low">The Kombucha</h2>
				<p class="gray">Kombucha is a fermented tea that is a recognized probiotic.  In simple terms, the production involves making  sweet tea, adding a SCOBY (symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast), and letting the SCOBY consume the sugar to produce a drink full of B vitamins, amino acids, organic acids, enzymes, and probiotics.  The SCOBY looks like a mix between a jellyfish and a mushroom.  It doesnâ€™t sound that appetizing, but what a nice nutritional trade off! You can also increase the carbonation by bottling it a second time in smaller containers after the first fermentation is complete.<p>
